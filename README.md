# ase-capstone

## Project Description

This capstone project is the development of a small-scale survival horror video game that explores how modern AI systems can be used as core gameplay mechanics, not just background optimization tools. The project focuses on designing and implementing AI-driven systems that actively influence tension, player decision-making, and moment-to-moment gameplay.

Rather than relying solely on scripted scares or static enemy behavior, the game leverages AI to create adaptive, unpredictable horror experiences. Enemy behavior, environmental responses, and pacing are designed to react dynamically to the player, reinforcing the core survival horror themes of vulnerability, uncertainty, and psychological pressure.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how contemporary AI-enabled development workflows and hardware-aware design principles can shape both software architecture and player experience in modern game development.

## Problem Domain

Traditional survival horror games often rely on handcrafted scripts, fixed enemy logic, and predetermined scare sequences. While effective, these approaches can limit replayability and reduce tension once patterns become recognizable.

This project addresses the challenge of:
- Creating fear and tension through adaptive systems rather than static scripting
- Designing AI that reacts meaningfully to player behavior, not just proximity or timers
- Structuring game code to support complex AI logic while remaining maintainable and performant
- Integrating AI systems in a way that enhances atmosphere, not just difficulty
- By focusing on AI as a first-class gameplay system, this project explores new ways to sustain horror through uncertainty and emergent behavior.

## Features & Requirements

### Features

- Adaptive Enemy AI
Enemies that learn from or respond to player behavior (movement patterns, noise, time spent in areas, previous encounters), creating unpredictable encounters rather than fixed patrol routes.

- AI-Driven Tension & Pacing System
A background system that dynamically adjusts enemy aggression, resource availability, or environmental events based on player stress indicators (time spent hiding, health, recent encounters).

- Psychological Horror Mechanics
AI-controlled environmental effects such as flickering lights, audio hallucinations, or false cues that respond to player actions rather than scripted triggers.

- Limited-Information Survival Gameplay
Mechanics emphasizing scarcity, visibility constraints, and imperfect information, reinforced by AI systems that exploit player uncertainty.

- Modular Architecture
Clear separation between AI decision-making, gameplay state, rendering, and audio systems to support experimentation and iteration.

- Playable Prototype
A complete vertical slice featuring exploration, enemy encounters, and AI-driven horror systems.

### Requirements

- Built using a modern game engine (e.g., Unreal Engine or Unity)
- AI systems must directly influence gameplay and player experience
- Emphasis on real-time performance and stability
- Clean, modular codebase following software engineering best practices
- Runs on consumer-grade hardware
- Fully documented systems and design decisions
